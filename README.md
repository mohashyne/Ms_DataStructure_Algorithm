An logrithm is the inverse of exponensiation

Whats is Log

log2  8 = 3

log2 (value) = exponent =========>  2 exponent = value

*   To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big O Notation
*   Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm
*   Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends (linear? quadratic? constant?)
*   The time or space complexity (as measured by Big O) • depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm




IF NOT TIME, THEN WHAT ?
Space Complexity: The amount of memory used by an algorithm.
Rather than counting seconds,
 which are so variable...
Let's count the number of
 simple operations the 
computer has to perform!
